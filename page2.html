                    <i>Sparky</i> is a Discord Bot and was made to handle a multiple variety of commands. The bot was made using 100% Python and uses multiple different libraries that Python has to offer.<br><br>
                    <i>Sparky</i> has plenty of modules within her files, the biggest being the <a id="ReferringLinks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game" title="Leads to Wikipedia" target="_blank">gacha</a> module with a boasting 2.3mb worth of storage and about 700 lines of Python code!<br><br>
                    <i>Sparky</i> was originally planned to be hooked up with a <a id="ReferringLinks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)" title="Leads to Wikipedia" target="_blank">Transformer</a> making her a potential AI, but that project was quickly put to hold and instead will have a different bot do that.<br><br>
                    <i>Sparky</i> being a disocrd bot, has many uses besides being a fun and entertaining bot to use! <i>Sparky</i> can also do moderation commands such as Kick, Ban, Unban, and Purge!<br><br>
                    The bot contains around 2,000 to 3,000 lines of Python code.<br><br>
                    <i>Sparky</i> has nine(9) modules excluding the main code file.<br><br>
                    <i>Sparky</i> utilizes a special <a id="ReferringLinks" href="https://dev.to/jacktt/understanding-the-weighted-random-algorithm-581p" title="Leads to DEV Community" target="_blank">weight RNG system</a> when calculating for the chances of getting a title!<br><br>
                    <i>Sparky</i> actually has two creators, the other one not wanting to be mentioned since she said she "didn't do much."
